### Variables
What does the app display in the Text components when it starts up?
- ... after the Change button is clicked?
- ... after the Change More button is clicked?
- ... after the Change More button is clicked again?

### Global Counter Render
Notice the difference between `globalCounterRender__globalButton.js` and `globalCounterReder__stateButton.js`.
- Why do they work differently?
- Why don't the Global Buttons update when they are clicked?  (Note that we haven't explored this in class yet, but explore the purpose of the "Force Re-render" button)
- If we wanted to re-implement `globalCounterReder__globalButton.js` in a way so that all "global buttons" share the same counter value (and don't use a global variable), how else can we design it?

### ASCII Ordinal Value
- How could you use a simple math formula to convert `var myChar = 'z';` to a capital 'Z' using ordinal values?
- If the semi-colon/colon key on your keyboard was broken, but you needed to render a semi-colon to the screen in your app, how could you do it?
